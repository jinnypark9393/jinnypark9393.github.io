**Question 1:**

> Yes, I do. I would like to be successful and my current career goal is to be recognized as best performer at Amazon Korea and move to Amazon Seattle office.
> 

→ (Correct)  "the best performer" at the Amazon Korea office and then eventually move to the Amazon HQ in Seattle.

<br/>

I didn't join the company yet, I will join Amazon Korea as a solutions architect at the end of this month.

<br/>

I read an essay by someone who didn't major in CS but has a similar path to mine.

<br/>

> She started career at an IT company but wasn't in charge of core part, and then switch her career path to engineer.
> 

→ (Correct) ...and then switched her career path to become an engineer.

<br/>

> Then, she joined Amazon Korea and finally she move to Amazon HQ.
> 

→ (Correct) Then, she joined Amazon Korea and was finally able to move to the Amazon HQ.

<br/>

> I've never imagine I could join Amazon Korea before a recruiter from Amazon Korea contacted me.
> 

→ (Correct) I never thought I would have this opportunity until a recruiter from Amazon Korea reached out to me.

<br/>

However, after reading this essay, now I believe that working at Silicon Valley is not just a dream but something can be achievable.

<br/>

I didn't major in CS and I joined an IT company, Japanese telecom company as a procurement team member.

<br/>

At first, I didn't have any interest in CS, but while I was working as a procurement team member, I had to buy routers, switchers and firewalls so I need to learn about how those network devices work.

<br/>

I studied certification exam related to network devices and I found studying CS, how network devices work is quite fun, interesting.

<br/>

> That's why I started studying CS and will switch my career to technical side.
> 

→ (Correct)  I started studying CS given the overlap with my previous job and am now planning to switch to the technical side of engineering.

<br/>

Question 2:

> My family helps my career most of the time. My parents listened to me what I did or what I experience from work and gave tips and advices.
> 

→ (Correct) In my opinion, my family aids me in advancing my career path. They listen to my concerns and issues while providing me with advice.

<br/>

> Sometimes I have an issue that I can't tell my colleagues and even my friends but I can tell almost everything to my family.
> 

→ (Correct) Sometimes there are issues I don't feel comfortable sharing with people outside of my family, I know I can trust them with almost anything.

<br/>

> Also, they help me make a better decision when I have to make a big one. About a year ago, I had to decide whether I would be looking to take on a new challenge as a DevOps Engineer or not.
> 

→ (Correct) They have provided me with lots of helpful advice when I have a large decision to make.

<br/>

> The reason I hesitated was that I've never have related experience of that position but my parents help me get rid of hesitant by expressing their thought that they will support even if I failed to the challenge.
> 

→ (Correct) My original concern was that I never had any work related experience for the position, but my parents encouraged me to apply / go for the role.

<br/>

So in many ways, my parents help my career develop a lot, but I don't think they interfere with my career.

<br/>

I think so because my parents never stopped to prevent us from challenging new things. For instance, in the case of my brother, when he was in middle school, he wanted to be a soccer player.

<br/>

And my parents said to go ahead, he even take a test to get into famous soccer team in Korea, but he didn't make it. But my parents didn't blame him and they wait until he find another interest.

<br/>

After that he had an interest in music and especially in composing songs. Then my parents also supported that.

<br/>

> While he studying composing classic song, he thought that he cannot join university with his current capability so my parents just recommend him to learn instrument not composing it.
> 

→ (Correct) He was studying the composition of classical songs, but wasn't advanced enough to join at the university level. Therefore, my parents recommended that he learn an instrument rather than compose music.

<br/>

But they didn't force to learn so he chose an instrument called tuba. Finally, he made it, he entered university in Germany

<br/>

My parents always support our dreams, not stop it.

> We normally don't support by work because we feel that it is very cringe. When we had a hard time or we have something to work on then we gave advices to each other. I think same applies to my brother and me.
> 

→ (Correct) We normally try to stray away from advice concerning our worklife since that is cringey. But when there are hard times, we can always count on each other to give advice.

<br/>

Question 5:

> Goals are changing so I will just constantly communicate my future goals with my partner.
> 

→ (Correct) My goals are always changing so I would like to keep an open line of communication with my partner.

<br/>

> Although I don't have a partner yet but I would love to share my future goals who are close to me and thus I will share current career goals with my partner right away.
> 

→ (Correct) Although I do not have a partner at the moment, once I am in a relationship, I would share my career plans with them immediately.

<br/>

> I believe the more we share our plans, the better the plans would be. That's because we can realize new things while we exchange our opinions and perspectives.
> 

→ (Correct) I believe that the stronger our communication, the better our plans will be. This is because we can plan for each other and tangentially make plans together rather than individually.

<br/>

> At the moment, I don't have permanent plan to be residential in the United States then I just plan to live about three to five years to experience HQ fully then I don't have plans after that.
> 

→ (Correct) I don't have a permanent plan to reside in the United States, I plan on living there for around 3-5 years to get the full experience working at the HQ.

<br/>

> I planned a lot in the past about my career goals, but things are changing really quickly so I think having flexibility with career is important. No, I don't have permanent plan to live in US.
> 

→ (Correct) In the past, I primarily focused on planning my career goals. However, things have changed immensely so I think flexibility in your occupation is really important.

<br/>

> 

→ (Correct) Another goal of mine, is to get certified at level four.

<br/>

I have gastritis right now so in the future I will studying about wine again.

> Until level three I can take an exam in Korea, but when it comes to level four, I have to study abroad and take an exam outside of Korea. For example, US, France, Hong Kong, like that. So it'll be after I start to work in Silicon Valley.
> 

→ (Correct) To get certified for the third level, I would take an exam in Korea. However, to get the highest certification, I would need to travel outside of Korea to someplace like [the countries that you listed].

<br/>

> Actually my brother introduced to me. Of course I have drunk wine, not learning it, not enjoying the aromas of wine. I just drank it, but after he lives in Germany, he also learns about wines from his friends.
> 

→ (Correct) explanation

<br/>

When he came back to Korea, he bought some wines from Germany and taught me how it smells and the aromas of wine. Riesling and grape variety, pineapple, passion fruits, gasoline like that.

<br/>

> This is very interesting to smell like that even if wines are made of just grapes so that's why I got interested in wine.
> 

→ (Correct) I found that despite wine being made from only grapes, it was very interesting to learn about the aromas and experience the different smells.

<br/>

> Many people who got level four consult wine importers or wine shops. I can try that one, but in the case of wine competition.
> 

→ (Correct) Those who receive a level four certification usually can serve as consultants for importers or wine shops.

<br/>

<br/>

Python is typically used to automate workflows and is helpful in implementing infrastructure which will be useful for my job.

<br/>

→ (Correct) Currently, I'm in the process of creating a web-scraping tool. I scrape data from a specific website and create an output table in an easily comprehensible format.

<br/>

> I heard that coding is not necessary when it comes to solutions architect. You have to propose an architecture for that company not actually implement so coding experience is highly recommend because I have to make a demo for the customer I need to code.
> 

→ (Correct) For this role, coding isn't necessary, but it's just highly recommended. I simply propose an architecture for the company, but don't implement the code myself.
