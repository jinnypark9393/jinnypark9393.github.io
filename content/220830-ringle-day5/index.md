**Q1. Which subjects did you enjoy the most in school? Why?**

A: I enjoyed Korean literature the most in high school and I enjoyed subjects which relates to History in college.

<br/>

When I was in high school, I loved to read all kinds of books such as Korean novels, Japanese novels, essays, arts, business and so on. Because I love knowing new things and experiencing various situations indirectly through books. And literature class is the subject that I can acquire those experiences the most.

<br/>

The reason why I liked subjects relates to History in college is basically the same as above. For instance, Japanese economic class made me understand unique culture of Japanese company better.

<br/>

**Q2. What did (or do) you study in college? Why did you choose that major?**

A: I studied economics in college. I choose economics because it is popular major of the college so that I can hired by a large company more easily.

<br/>

I got into Japanese university and a prominent major of the prominent university decides which company I will be able to apply. Japanese companies barely care about what we learn in class. They care about which university I graduated and what we did in extracurricular activities more. For instance, when I was looking for a job in Japan, remaining seats for the job fair shows differently for me and my friend. Even if we graduated same college, I can only apply for the large company's job fair only because I chose the prominent major.

<br/>

**Q3. Why do you think majors and careers don’t always align?**

A: I think the reason majors and careers don’t always align is that our interests keep changing while we are learning about the major and experiencing lots of new things.
