**Have you used Notion before?**

Yes I have. Actually, I use Notion ~~in~~ on a daily basis.

<br/>

I think that Notion is not just a note-taking tool anymore.

<br/>

First and foremost, Notion can be a team collaboration tool by using the sharing option. When I was preparing for my  Kubernetes Certification with my colleagues, we used Notion a lot. ~~w~~ We can edit same Notion page in real-time. Thus, we can share feedback via Notion immediately.

<br/>

> We can edit same Notion page in real-time. Thus, we can share feedback via Notion immediately.

→ (Correction) Since we were able to edit the same Notion page in real-time, we were able to immediately share feedback via Notion.
> 

<br/>

Also, ~~Y~~ you can use Notion to build a  simple static website. You don't need to know what HTML, CSS, and Javascript ~~is~~ are. All you need to do is just choose your template, write down what you want to say, and click "Share to web".

<br/>

Last but not least, Notion can be a database. If you choose the  "database" template, you can use Notion as database.

<br/>

> Last but not least, Notion can be a database. If you choose the "database" template, you can use Notion as database. 

→ (Correction) Last but not least, if you choose the "database" template, you can now use Notion as a database as well.

<br/>

**Q. Do you prefer digital note-taking or handwriting? Explain.**

I used to prefer handwriting but thanks to Notion, I prefer digital note-taking now.

<br/>

What I ~~most love~~ love most  about Notion is their  "insert code block" functionality. I can simply insert code block by typing a backtick three times.

> a backtick three times.

→ (Correction) three backticks
> 

<br/>

Also, Notion supports ~~markdown~~ Markdown language. I built my blog with Github Pages and Gatsby. Gatsby is a static web site generator tool and I need to use Markdown ~~language~~   to post an article on my blog. When I use Markdown ~~language~~    I cannot see what the post ~~exactly will~~ will exactly look like. But Using Notion, I can instantly  see the output of the post ~~right away.~~

<br/>

> and I need to use Markdown  to post an article on my blog.

→ (Correction) which requires Markdown to publish articles onto the blog.
> 

<br/>

> right away 

→ (Correction) instantly
> 

Due to the extra functionality that Notion provides me with, I've come to love and prefer it for note-taking.

<br/>

**Q. What productivity apps do you use, and have they improved your life? Explain.**

I use "GoodNotes" to improve productivity.

<br/>

"GoodNotes" is a note-taking tool which is specialized in handwriting. Using GoodNotes with an iPad, you can draw diagrams and pictures what you used to do with physical handwriting. ~~You can also take a note with GoodNotes and y~~  You can even search your handwritten notes.

<br/>

> is specialized in handwriting

→ (Correction) specializes in supporting handwriting.
> 

<br/>

> what you used to do with physical handwriting.

→ (Correction) just like you can do with physical handwriting.
> 

<br/>

> You can even search your handwritten notes.

→ (Correction) Once you've taken your notes, you can digitally organize them and even search through them for specific phrases.
