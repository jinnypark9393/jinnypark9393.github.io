다음 달부터 미국계 CSP 사로 출근을 하게 되었는데, 영어를 사용한지 꽤 오래되어 그런지 많이 녹슨 듯 해 영어회화 앱을 통해 실력을 향상해보고자 한다. 링글(Ringle)이라는 플랫폼을 선택한 이유에 대해서는 별도 포스팅을 할 예정이지만, 입사 전에 덜컥 거금(?)의 강의를 신청한 이유는 링글의 “실리콘 밸리 챌린지" 때문.

<br/>

나는 실리콘 밸리 챌린지 거의 끝물에 시작해서 참가자격을 얻으려면 어마어마하게 자주 수업을 들어야하지만, 최근 “IT회사에 간 문과 여자"라는 책을 읽고 나도 실리콘밸리에 가고싶다! 라는 생각이 들어 헐레벌떡 신청했다.

**Q1. Have you heard of Software as a Service? What are your thoughts on the SaaS industry in general?**

Sure, I have. I support to implement SaaS product such as ServiceNow, Microsoft Dynamics 365 in my previous job. Also, I have used SaaS ~~product~~ products  a lot like M365, Workday, and  Salesforce in the past.

I consider SaaS industry ~~is~~ to be  familiar with many people but there is plenty of room for growth. Because many ~~company~~ companies  would like to automate repetitive tasks and optimize the cost. Also, ~~Many~~ many  ~~company~~ companies  already get used to pay-per-use business model through Infrastructure as a Service like AWS.

**Q2. Do you use Software as a Service at your workplace? Why or why not?**

I  have used lots of SaaS ~~product~~ products  like M365, Workday, Salesforce, and  DocuSign in the past. One of the biggest reason for using SaaS is COVID-19. Companies had to implement remote work ~~environment~~ environments  due to the  pandemic but developing systems and setting up all those infrastructure for them is extremely difficult.

<br/>

When I was in N** Korea, a subsidiary of a  Japanese telecommunications company, I tried adopting e-contract services after I experienced the  e-contract SaaS service, DocuSign. However, I gave up on proposing it because many Korean companies just adhered to paper-based ~~contract~~ contracts  at that moment. But after COVID-19, many Korean companies ~~start~~ started  to introduce e-contract ~~system~~ systems .

<br/>

**Q3. What problems have you encountered when using SaaS products? In what ways have they been helpful for your business?**

I found SaaS products, especially global SaaS products ~~are~~   lack ~~of~~   flexibility~~,~~   in terms of customization.

<br/>

I worked ~~for~~ on an MS Dynamics 365 implementation project for a Korean office of the multi-national pharmaceutical firm as a PMO. During the project, the biggest challenge ~~is~~ was that  global SaaS products ~~doesn't~~ don't  consider local regulations and ~~practice~~ practices, so ~~it~~ they  needs additional development for customization.
