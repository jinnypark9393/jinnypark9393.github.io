**Q3. Have you ever used team collaboration tools such as Notion and Slack? What was your experience like?**

Yes, I have used both Notion and Slack and **I** love them so much.

I started using Notion a year ago because one of my colleagues ~~recommend~~ recommended it to me. Notion is **a** very powerful tool, **because** it is easy to convert into PDF, Markdown, and it can be converted into a website.

> (Correction) I started using Notion a year ago because one of my colleagues recommended it to me.
> 

→ change the verb "recommend" to past tense. Great use of the word "colleague" here!

Also, I find Slack is **a** very handy collaboration tool, especially for developer**s**. Slack provides APIs to integrate other tools and it supports markdown language so it's very easy to embed code ~~in the~~ into the  message.

> (Correction) markdown language
> 

→ a is for singular nouns that are not specific. The is for specific singular and plural nouns. Since here you use markdown language as a specific language, there is no need to include either "a" or "the".

> (Correction) Also, I consider that Slack is a very helpful collaboration tool, especially for developers.
> 

→ "find" can be replaced with "think" or "consider that" since these words best fit the context of this sentence.  We make "developer" plural as "developers" because we are talking in general about developers.

**Q4. The article says in some companies’ cyber security policies ban the use of team collaboration tools. Is your company one of them?**

Yes, we are. Currently, I am working on ~~the~~ a  project ~~at~~ for Samsung. As I am working at **a** client'**s** office, ~~it is~~ my company  banned ~~to~~ the  use **of** team collaboration tools ~~following by~~ according to the client's security policy. Their security policy bans Slack, Notion, Google office tools and even MS Teams. They ~~uses~~ use  their own team collaboration tools but it is quite slow and not user-friendly.

> AS I am working client' office, it is banned use team collaboration tools following by client's security policy.
> 

As I am working at a client' s office, my company banned the use of team collaboration tools according to the client's security policy.

The reason why we replace "following by" with "according to the" is because

**following**

is a verb which requires a pronoun before it (ex: "I was following"), while

**according to**

is not a verb and does not require a pronoun which is the case in this sentence.

**Q6. Do you believe the rise of the team collaboration tools continues?**

I believe the rise of the team collaboration tools continues. Since we are still going through the pandemic, the importance of the tools for remote work is growing and will **continue to** grow in the future as well.

> (Correction) the importance of the tools for remote work is growing in the present and will continue to grow in the future.
> 

→ In this context, because the word "grow" is used to convey a similar message but for two different things (the present time and the future), it is okay to use the word twice within the same sentence. However, if repeated words could be simplified, it is often best to do that. For example, if I say: "I wish that my school had **chocolate ice cream** because **chocolate ice cream** is so good!" I can refer to the second "chocolate ice cream" mentioned as "it" which is shorter and more simple.

When I worked at NTT Korea, a subsidiary of a Japanese telecom company, **this** company introduced Microsoft Sharepoint globally to promote 'Work from home'. MS Sharepoint is relatively slow for ~~using~~   real-time collaboration but it was very useful because I can access more information from the integrated platform.

> (Correction) at that company
