I think the death of internet explorer is not that important for most of people. but it was significant for me personally. this is because internet explorer now doesn't have significant position at browser market. internet explorer cant hold even 5% while chrome holds about 65% of the browser market. However, it was significant issue for me because my project schedule at my current job has been delayed for 4 months because of the death of Internet Explorer.

I believe the death of Internet Explorer is not too significant for most people, however it was very important for me. This would be because Internet Explorer does not have a significant position in the browser market because it can't even hold 5% of the browser market while, on the other hand Chrome holds about 65% of it. Because of that, it was a very significant issue for me as my project schedule at my current job was delayed for 4 months due to the death of Internet Explorer.

I think that because it takes time to adapt new circumstance and we need to make an effort to adjust. These additional efforts for new product or new technology lower the productivity in short term even if it is more efficient than existing one in long term.

<br/>

I believe that because it takes a long time to adapt to new circumstances, and we are unwilling to make the effort to adjust to something out of our normal lives. These additional efforts for newer products or new technology lower productivity in the short term even if it is more efficient in the long term, however changing from the technology that we are used to is hard and would take a lot of time.

I believe they aim to lock in their clients by releasing their own browsers. Like Microsoft did in the past with windows and internet explorer. i believe Google was able to attract to Gmail and Google cloud by promoting increase of the Google chrome browser users.

→ (Correct) I believe that they aim to lock in their customers by releasing their browsers to everyone for free. Much like how Microsoft did in the past with windows and Internet Explorer, I believe that Google was able to pull in more customers and users through their Gmail and Google Cloud services than Microsoft ever could in recent times.

I have used Microsoft internet explorer, before i used Google chrome browser. It was not bad, when it comes to using banking solutions in Korea. In Korea there are some particular security solutions for banking and it is optimized for internet explorer, not Google chrome browser or fire fox browser. it was not that bad but when i used internet explorer at work there was an issue that internet explorer doesn't support the encoding from ASCII to UTF8.

→ (Correct) I have used Microsoft's Internet Explorer before I started using the Google Chrome browser. I don't believe that it was a bad browser because when it comes to banking solutions in Korea there are specific security solutions that rely on Internet Explorer, not Google Chrome or Fire Fox. However, when I was using Internet Explorer at work there was an issue with how Internet Explorer handles the encoding from ASCII to UTF8, which caused problems for me at work.
