**Q2. What should one consider when choosing their major or career path?**

I think sustainability goes first. For example, if I have no interest in what I do then my job or major is not sustainable. I don't want to improve my skills for the job and I'll end up hating the job. Also, we have to keep watching if our major or career is needed in society.

<br/>

> (Correction) I think job sustainability is the most important factor. For example, a job is not sustainable if I have no interest in it. I will not want to improve my skills for the job and end up hating it. Also, we have to keep watch for whether our major or career is desired or needed in society.

**Q3. If you work in STEM, do you have a job that didn't exist a century ago?**

Yes, I'm currently work as a DevOps engineer which didn't exist 20th century. DevOps engineers are an IT generalists who should have a wide-ranging knowledge of both development and operations.

A century ago, the concept of 'computer' is not common. The 'computer' in that era has very limited functions and only limited people have access to it. So there wasn't such a job, 'DevOps Engineer'. However, with rapid increase in computing power, demand for developers has risen sharply. Handling applications and infrastructure is getting complex. That's why DevOps engineer exists. DevOps engineer helps developers focus on their core task by configure the automated environment for them.

> (Correction) Even just a century ago, the concept of computers was not common. Computers in that era had very limited functionalities and limited to people who had access to it. Therefore, DevOps did not exist as a career. However, with rapid increase in computing power, demand for developers has risen sharply, and handling applications and infrastructure got more complicated. That's why this career came into existence. DevOps engineers assist developers to focus on their core task by configuring an automated environment for them.

**Q4. If you don't work in STEM, do you feel the need to enhance your knowledge and skills in that area? Why or why not?**

I do work in STEM but I consider that everyone including people don't work in STEM needs to enhance their knowledge and skills in that area. Because we are living with Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics.

<br/>

> (Correction) I do work in STEM but I believe / think everyone who does not work in STEM needs to enhance their knowledge and skills in this area because we are living in a science - oriented society.

Among STEM, I feel that enhancing knowledge regarding technology is the most important. For instance, when I worked in the procurement team at NTT Korea, a subsidiary of Japanese telecom company, HQ introduced an automation tool called UiPath. UiPath can automate repetitive task by 'recording' your tasks with it. So, if you have a little more interest in technology, you can avoid hassles and focus on the core value.
