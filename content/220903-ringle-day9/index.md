# 3. 복습

## 1. **Fluency**

I think I know what I have to learn, overall. But I didn't have idea on what I actually work on. I heard that they gave me 6 months to train, and then I need to face to my customers. During 6 months I have to do some assignment.

→ (Correction) I think I have some idea of what it is I'll need to learn, but I don't think I know yet what my actual work will be focused on. I heard that they typically give 6 months for training, during which I have to do some assignment, before I can face customers.

→ (Comment) Changed some grammar and vocabulary to increase fluency and show some alternate phrasing.

<br/>

So I didn't build an application by myself, so I just plan to build an application with my ex colleagues. We were thinking about what we are going to make, but before we make a bigger app, we just start off by making a portfolio website for us. It's gonna be simple app for as a starting point, and then we are going to make a service.

→ (Correction) I am planning to build an application with colleagues, so that I'm not just working by myself. We are considering building a larger scale app, but we will start small, and just make portfolios first....

→ (Comments) Small changes, and rephrased a few sentences. For example, using "considering" and "large scale".

<br/>

## 2. **Vocabulary**

I need to learn how these network devices work. After I achieved that certifications, I changed my career as a project manager closer to the technical side. Then I started to have interest in cloud services.

→ (Correction) In my past career path I needed to gain knowledge in the area of network devices. Once I got the proper certifications, I was able to transfer to a more technical side....

→ (Comments) Rephrased slightly for added vocabulary.

<br/>

## 3. **Pronunciation**

Some words that I noted errors in pronunciation: pivoted, weakness
