What should one consider when choosing their major or career path?</strong></p>\n<p>I think sustainability goes first. For example, if I have no interest in what I do then my job or major is not sustainable. I don’t want to improve my skills for the job and I’ll end up hating the job. Also, we have to keep watching if our major or career is needed in society.</p>\n<br/>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(Correction) I think job sustainability is the most important factor.

The ‘computer’ in that era has very limited functions and only limited people have access to it. So there wasn’t such a job, ‘DevOps Engineer’. However, with rapid increase in computing power, demand for developers has risen sharply. Handling applications and infrastructure is getting complex. That’s why DevOps engineer exists. DevOps engineer helps developers focus on their core task by configure the automated environment for them.</p>\n<br/>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(Correction) Even just a century ago, the concept of computers was not common.

That’s why this career came into existence. DevOps engineers assist developers to focus on their core task by configuring an automated environment for them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\n<p><strong>Q4. If you don’t work in STEM, do you feel the need to enhance your knowledge and skills in that area? Why or why not?</strong></p>\n<p>I do work in STEM but I consider that everyone including people don’t work in STEM needs to enhance their knowledge and skills in that area. Because we are living with Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics.</p>\n<br/>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(Correction) I do work in STEM but I believe / think everyone who does not work in STEM needs to enhance their knowledge and skills in this area because we are living in a science - oriented society.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\n<p>Among STEM, I feel that enhancing knowledge regarding technology is the most important. For instance, when I worked in the procurement team at NTT Korea, a subsidiary of Japanese telecom company, HQ introduced an automation tool called UiPath. UiPath can automate repetitive task by ‘recording’ your tasks with it. So, if you have a little more interest in technology, you can avoid hassles and focus on the core value.</p>\n<br/>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(Correction) Among STEM, I feel that enhancing knowledge regarding technology is the most important.

Have you ever used team collaboration tools such as Notion and Slack? What was your experience like?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, I have used both Notion and Slack and <strong>I</strong> love them so much.</p>\n<p>I started using Notion a year ago because one of my colleagues <del>recommend</del> recommended it to me. Notion is <strong>a</strong> very powerful tool, <strong>because</strong> it is easy to convert into PDF, Markdown, and it can be converted into a website.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(Correction) I started using Notion a year ago because one of my colleagues recommended it to me.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>→ change the verb “recommend” to past tense. Great use of the word “colleague” here!</p>\n<p>Also, I find Slack is <strong>a</strong> very handy collaboration tool, especially for developer<strong>s</strong>. Slack provides APIs to integrate other tools and it supports markdown language so it’s very easy to embed code <del>in the</del> into the  message.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(Correction) markdown language</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>→ a is for singular nouns that are not specific. The is for specific singular and plural nouns. Since here you use markdown language as a specific language, there is no need to include either “a” or “the”.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(Correction) Also, I consider that Slack is a very helpful collaboration tool, especially for developers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>→ “find” can be replaced with “think” or “consider that” since these words best fit the context of this sentence.  We make “developer” plural as “developers” because we are talking in general about developers.</p>\n<p><strong>Q4. The article says in some companies’ cyber security policies ban the use of team collaboration tools. Is your company one of them?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, we are.

As I am working at <strong>a</strong> client’<strong>s</strong> office, <del>it is</del> my company  banned <del>to</del> the  use <strong>of</strong> team collaboration tools <del>following by</del> according to the client’s security policy. Their security policy bans Slack, Notion, Google office tools and even MS Teams. They <del>uses</del> use  their own team collaboration tools but it is quite slow and not user-friendly.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>AS I am working client’ office, it is banned use team collaboration tools following by client’s security policy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As I am working at a client’ s office, my company banned the use of team collaboration tools according to the client’s security policy.</p>\n<p>The reason why we replace “following by” with “according to the” is because</p>\n<p><strong>following</strong></p>\n<p>is a verb which requires a pronoun before it (ex: “I was following”), while</p>\n<p><strong>according to</strong></p>\n<p>is not a verb and does not require a pronoun which is the case in this sentence.</p>\n<p><strong>Q6. Do you believe the rise of the team collaboration tools continues?</strong></p>\n<p>I believe the rise of the team collaboration tools continues. Since we are still going through the pandemic, the importance of the tools for remote work is growing and will <strong>continue to</strong> grow in the future as well.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(Correction) the importance of the tools for remote work is growing in the present and will continue to grow in the future.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>→ In this context, because the word “grow” is used to convey a similar message but for two different things (the present time and the future), it is okay to use the word twice within the same sentence. However, if repeated words could be simplified, it is often best to do that. For example, if I say: “I wish that my school had <strong>chocolate ice cream</strong> because <strong>chocolate ice cream</strong> is so good!” I can refer to the second “chocolate ice cream” mentioned as “it” which is shorter and more simple.</p>\n<p>When I worked at NTT Korea, a subsidiary of a Japanese telecom company, <strong>this</strong> company introduced Microsoft Sharepoint globally to promote ‘Work from home’. MS Sharepoint is relatively slow for <del>using</del>   real-time collaboration but it was very useful because I can access more information from the integrated platform.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(Correction) at that company</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>","frontmatter":{"date":"August 26, 2022","title":"220825 링글(Ringle) 2회차 수업 후기","categories":"english","author":"jinnypark9393","emoji":"🟣"},"fields":{"slug":"/220826-ringle-day2/"}},"prev":{"id":"fc4fc0da-7963-51d2-857f-a2aa80ff6b02","html":"<h1 id=\"제-6장-그-외의-알고리즘들1\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#%EC%A0%9C-6%EC%9E%A5-%EA%B7%B8-%EC%99%B8%EC%9D%98-%EC%95%8C%EA%B3%A0%EB%A6%AC%EC%A6%98%EB%93%A41\" aria-label=\"제 6장 그 외의 알고리즘들1 permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>제 6장: 그 외의 알고리즘들(1)</h1>\n<h2 id=\"column-관계형-데이터베이스를-이용한-정렬과-검색\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#column-%EA%B4%80%EA%B3%84%ED%98%95-%EB%8D%B0%EC%9D%B4%ED%84%B0%EB%B2%A0%EC%9D%B4%EC%8A%A4%EB%A5%BC-%EC%9D%B4%EC%9A%A9%ED%95%9C-%EC%A0%95%EB%A0%AC%EA%B3%BC-%EA%B2%80%EC%83%89\" aria-label=\"column 관계형 데이터베이스를 이용한 정렬과 검색 permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Column: 관계형 데이터베이스를 이용한 정렬과 검색</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>관계형 데이터베이스: 대량의 데이터를 효율적으로 처리(개발과 유지보수 용이)\n<ul>\n<li>프로그램을 두개의 역할로 나눠 분담하게 할 수 있기 때문\n<ul>\n<li>프로그램을 실행하는 코드</li>\n<li>데이터 관리</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>데이터베이스를 활용해 특정 데이터를 정렬하거나 검색 → SQL 언어 사용</li>\n<li>SQL문의 지식과 질 좋은 알고리즘의 학습으로 데이터를 효율적으로 검색하거나 정렬할 수 있다.</li>\n</ul>\n<br/>\n<h2 id=\"66-미분을-활용해-고차-방정식의-해를-구하는-뉴턴법\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#66-%EB%AF%B8%EB%B6%84%EC%9D%84-%ED%99%9C%EC%9A%A9%ED%95%B4-%EA%B3%A0%EC%B0%A8-%EB%B0%A9%EC%A0%95%EC%8B%9D%EC%9D%98-%ED%95%B4%EB%A5%BC-%EA%B5%AC%ED%95%98%EB%8A%94-%EB%89%B4%ED%84%B4%EB%B2%95\" aria-label=\"66 미분을 활용해 고차 방정식의 해를 구하는 뉴턴법 permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>66. 미분을 활용해 고차 방정식의 해를 구하는 ‘뉴턴법’</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>뉴턴법: 함수 f(x)가 x축과 만날 때, f(x)와 도함수 f’(x)를 이용해 f(x)=0의 해 x를 구하는 알고리즘</li>\n<li>예시: $x^2=k$ 일때, $x=±\\sqrt{k}$ 이므로, $f(x)=x^2-k$의 올바른 해는 $k$이다.</li>\n<li>위의 예시에서 $k$를 구하는 방법\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>함수 그래프의 임의의 점 $P_0(x_0, f(x_0))$ 에서의 점선의 기울기 → $f(x)=x^2-k$의 도함수 $f’(x)=2x$ 로 구할 수 있으므로,</p>\n<p>i. $f’(x_0)=2_{x0}$</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>접선의 기울기 = $\\frac{y의 \\ 변화량}{x의 \\ 변화량}$ 이므로, $P_0$의 접선이 x축과 만나는 점을 $x_1$이라고 하면 $f’(x_0) = \\frac{f(x_0)}{x_0-x_1}$이므로, i에 의해</p>\n<p>ii. $2x_0 = \\frac{f(x_0)}{x_0-x_1}$</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>$f(x_0)=x_0^2-k$ 이므로, i에 의해 $2x_0=\\frac{x_0^2-k}{x_0-x_1}$ 이 되며, 이 식을 변형하면</p>\n<p>$2x_0(x_0-x_1)=x_0^2-k$ → $x_0-x_1=\\frac{x_0^2-k}{2x_0}$ → $x_1=x_0 - \\frac{x_0^2-k}{2x_0}$우</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>위 식을 $P_1(x_1,f(x_1))$, $P_2(x_2,f(x_2))$에도 동일하게 적용시키면</p>\n<p>iii. $x_2=x_1=\\frac{x_1^2-k}{2x_1}$, $x_3=x_2=\\frac{x_2^2-k}{2x_2}$, … 이 되어 $x_n=x_{n-1}=\\frac{x_{n-1}^2-k}{2x_{n-1}}$따</p>\n<p>따라서, $x_0$ 에 적당한 값을 부여하고, $x_n$, $x_{n-1}$ 값의 차이가 충분히 작아질 때까지 iii의 계산을 반복하면 $x_n$의 값이 $\\sqrt{k}$의 근사값이 된다.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<br/>","frontmatter":{"date":"August 27, 2022","title":"그림으로 배우는 알고리즘 제 5장 - 정렬과 검색 (9)","categories":"알고리즘","author":"jinnypark9393","emoji":"🤖"},"fields":{"slug":"/220828-algorithm-book-with-pic/"}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"siteUrl":"https://jinnypark9393.github.io","comments":{"utterances":{"repo":"jinnypark9393/jinnypark9393.github.io"}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/220827-ringle-day3/","nextSlug":"/220826-ringle-day2/","prevSlug":"/220828-algorithm-book-with-pic/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1073350324","1956554647","2938748437"]}
