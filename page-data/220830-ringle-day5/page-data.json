Which subjects did you enjoy the most in school? Why?</strong></p>\n<p>A: I enjoyed Korean literature the most in high school and I enjoyed subjects which relates to History in college.</p>\n<br/>\n<p>When I was in high school, I loved to read all kinds of books such as Korean novels, Japanese novels, essays, arts, business and so on. Because I love knowing new things and experiencing various situations indirectly through books. And literature class is the subject that I can acquire those experiences the most.</p>\n<br/>\n<p>The reason why I liked subjects relates to History in college is basically the same as above. For instance, Japanese economic class made me understand unique culture of Japanese company better.</p>\n<br/>\n<p><strong>Q2. What did (or do) you study in college? Why did you choose that major?</strong></p>\n<p>A: I studied economics in college. I choose economics because it is popular major of the college so that I can hired by a large company more easily.</p>\n<br/>\n<p>I got into Japanese university and a prominent major of the prominent university decides which company I will be able to apply. Japanese companies barely care about what we learn in class. They care about which university I graduated and what we did in extracurricular activities more. For instance, when I was looking for a job in Japan, remaining seats for the job fair shows differently for me and my friend. Even if we graduated same college, I can only apply for the large company’s job fair only because I chose the prominent major.</p>\n<br/>\n<p><strong>Q3. Why do you think majors and careers don’t always align?</strong></p>\n<p>A: I think the reason majors and careers don’t always align is that our interests keep changing while we are learning about the major and experiencing lots of new things.</p>\n<br/>","excerpt":"1. 기본정보 일정 2022년 8월 28일 20:00 (40분) 튜터 정보 튜터 이름: Clare 튜터 대학 / 전공: Stanford University / Computer Science 2. 사전 준비 1.

Actually, I use Notion <del>in</del> on a daily basis.</p>\n<br/>\n<p>I think that Notion is not just a note-taking tool anymore.</p>\n<br/>\n<p>First and foremost, Notion can be a team collaboration tool by using the sharing option. When I was preparing for my  Kubernetes Certification with my colleagues, we used Notion a lot. <del>w</del> We can edit same Notion page in real-time. Thus, we can share feedback via Notion immediately.</p>\n<br/>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We can edit same Notion page in real-time. Thus, we can share feedback via Notion immediately.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>→ (Correction) Since we were able to edit the same Notion page in real-time, we were able to immediately share feedback via Notion.</p>\n<blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\n<p>Also, <del>Y</del> you can use Notion to build a  simple static website. You don’t need to know what HTML, CSS, and Javascript <del>is</del> are. All you need to do is just choose your template, write down what you want to say, and click “Share to web”.</p>\n<br/>\n<p>Last but not least, Notion can be a database. If you choose the  “database” template, you can use Notion as database.</p>\n<br/>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Last but not least, Notion can be a database. If you choose the “database” template, you can use Notion as database.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>→ (Correction) Last but not least, if you choose the “database” template, you can now use Notion as a database as well.</p>\n<blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\n<p><strong>Q. Do you prefer digital note-taking or handwriting? Explain.</strong></p>\n<p>I used to prefer handwriting but thanks to Notion, I prefer digital note-taking now.</p>\n<br/>\n<p>What I <del>most love</del> love most  about Notion is their  “insert code block” functionality. I can simply insert code block by typing a backtick three times.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>a backtick three times.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>→ (Correction) three backticks</p>\n<blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\n<p>Also, Notion supports <del>markdown</del> Markdown language. I built my blog with Github Pages and Gatsby. Gatsby is a static web site generator tool and I need to use Markdown <del>language</del>   to post an article on my blog. When I use Markdown <del>language</del>    I cannot see what the post <del>exactly will</del> will exactly look like. But Using Notion, I can instantly  see the output of the post <del>right away.</del></p>\n<br/>\n<blockquote>\n<p>and I need to use Markdown  to post an article on my blog.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>→ (Correction) which requires Markdown to publish articles onto the blog.</p>\n<blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\n<blockquote>\n<p>right away</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>→ (Correction) instantly</p>\n<blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Due to the extra functionality that Notion provides me with, I’ve come to love and prefer it for note-taking.</p>\n<br/>\n<p><strong>Q. What productivity apps do you use, and have they improved your life? Explain.</strong></p>\n<p>I use “GoodNotes” to improve productivity.</p>\n<br/>\n<p>“GoodNotes” is a note-taking tool which is specialized in handwriting.
