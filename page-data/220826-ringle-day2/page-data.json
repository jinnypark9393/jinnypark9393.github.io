Have you ever used team collaboration tools such as Notion and Slack? What was your experience like?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, I have used both Notion and Slack and <strong>I</strong> love them so much.</p>\n<p>I started using Notion a year ago because one of my colleagues <del>recommend</del> recommended it to me. Notion is <strong>a</strong> very powerful tool, <strong>because</strong> it is easy to convert into PDF, Markdown, and it can be converted into a website.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(Correction) I started using Notion a year ago because one of my colleagues recommended it to me.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>→ change the verb “recommend” to past tense. Great use of the word “colleague” here!</p>\n<p>Also, I find Slack is <strong>a</strong> very handy collaboration tool, especially for developer<strong>s</strong>. Slack provides APIs to integrate other tools and it supports markdown language so it’s very easy to embed code <del>in the</del> into the  message.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(Correction) markdown language</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>→ a is for singular nouns that are not specific. The is for specific singular and plural nouns. Since here you use markdown language as a specific language, there is no need to include either “a” or “the”.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(Correction) Also, I consider that Slack is a very helpful collaboration tool, especially for developers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>→ “find” can be replaced with “think” or “consider that” since these words best fit the context of this sentence.  We make “developer” plural as “developers” because we are talking in general about developers.</p>\n<p><strong>Q4. The article says in some companies’ cyber security policies ban the use of team collaboration tools. Is your company one of them?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, we are. Currently, I am working on <del>the</del> a  project <del>at</del> for Samsung. As I am working at <strong>a</strong> client’<strong>s</strong> office, <del>it is</del> my company  banned <del>to</del> the  use <strong>of</strong> team collaboration tools <del>following by</del> according to the client’s security policy. Their security policy bans Slack, Notion, Google office tools and even MS Teams. They <del>uses</del> use  their own team collaboration tools but it is quite slow and not user-friendly.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>AS I am working client’ office, it is banned use team collaboration tools following by client’s security policy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As I am working at a client’ s office, my company banned the use of team collaboration tools according to the client’s security policy.</p>\n<p>The reason why we replace “following by” with “according to the” is because</p>\n<p><strong>following</strong></p>\n<p>is a verb which requires a pronoun before it (ex: “I was following”), while</p>\n<p><strong>according to</strong></p>\n<p>is not a verb and does not require a pronoun which is the case in this sentence.</p>\n<p><strong>Q6. Do you believe the rise of the team collaboration tools continues?</strong></p>\n<p>I believe the rise of the team collaboration tools continues. Since we are still going through the pandemic, the importance of the tools for remote work is growing and will <strong>continue to</strong> grow in the future as well.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(Correction) the importance of the tools for remote work is growing in the present and will continue to grow in the future.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>→ In this context, because the word “grow” is used to convey a similar message but for two different things (the present time and the future), it is okay to use the word twice within the same sentence. However, if repeated words could be simplified, it is often best to do that. For example, if I say: “I wish that my school had <strong>chocolate ice cream</strong> because <strong>chocolate ice cream</strong> is so good!” I can refer to the second “chocolate ice cream” mentioned as “it” which is shorter and more simple.</p>\n<p>When I worked at NTT Korea, a subsidiary of a Japanese telecom company, <strong>this</strong> company introduced Microsoft Sharepoint globally to promote ‘Work from home’. MS Sharepoint is relatively slow for <del>using</del>   real-time collaboration but it was very useful because I can access more information from the integrated platform.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(Correction) at that company</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>","excerpt":"1. 기본정보 일정 2022년 8월 25일 22:00 (40분) 튜터 정보 튜터 이름: Liz 튜터 대학 / 전공: Princeton University / Computer Science 2. 사전 준비 1.

I support to implement SaaS product such as ServiceNow, Microsoft Dynamics 365 in my previous job. Also, I have used SaaS <del>product</del> products  a lot like M365, Workday, and  Salesforce in the past.</p>\n<br/>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Correction:</strong> support to implement ~</p>\n<p>→ supported the implementation of SaaS products</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\n<p>I consider SaaS industry <del>is</del> to be  familiar with many people but there is plenty of room for growth. Because many <del>company</del> companies  would like to automate repetitive tasks and optimize the cost. Also, <del>Many</del> many  <del>company</del> companies  already get used to pay-per-use business model through Infrastructure as a Service like AWS.</p>\n<br/>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Correction:</strong> get used to</p>\n<p>have become accustomed to the</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\n<p><strong>Q2. Do you use Software as a Service at your workplace? Why or why not?</strong></p>\n<p>I  have used lots of SaaS <del>product</del> products  like M365, Workday, Salesforce, and  DocuSign in the past. One of the biggest reason for using SaaS is COVID-19. Companies had to implement remote work <del>environment</del> environments  due to the  pandemic but developing systems and setting up all those infrastructure for them is extremely difficult.</p>\n<br/>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Synonyms:</strong> difficult</p>\n<p>→ arduous (lots of work involved. Time-consuming)</p>\n<p>→ challenging (could be more work involved, or less work but of a harder caliber)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\n<p>When I was in N** Korea, a subsidiary of a  Japanese telecommunications company, I tried adopting e-contract services after I experienced the  e-contract SaaS service, DocuSign. However, I gave up on proposing it because many Korean companies just adhered to paper-based <del>contract</del> contracts  at that moment. But after COVID-19, many Korean companies <del>start</del> started  to introduce e-contract <del>system</del> systems .</p>\n<br/>\n<p><strong>Q3.

In what ways have they been helpful for your business?</strong></p>\n<p>I found SaaS products, especially global SaaS products <del>are</del>   lack <del>of</del>   flexibility~~,~~   in terms of customization.</p>\n<br/>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Better Expression:</strong> I found SaaS products, especially global SaaS products  lack  flexibility  in terms of customization.</p>\n<p>My main gripe with SaaS products, especially global ones, is that they are sorely lacking in terms of customization ability.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\n<p>I worked <del>for</del> on an MS Dynamics 365 implementation project for a Korean office of the multi-national pharmaceutical firm as a PMO. During the project, the biggest challenge <del>is</del> was that  global SaaS products <del>doesn’t</del> don’t  consider local regulations and <del>practice</del> practices, so <del>it</del> they  needs additional development for customization.</p>\n<br/>","frontmatter":{"date":"August 25, 2022","title":"220824 링글(Ringle) 1회차 수업 후기","categories":"english","author":"jinnypark9393","emoji":"🟣"},"fields":{"slug":"/220825-ringle-day1/"}},"prev":{"id":"4b2240df-5c81-53bd-a3f6-8ec4fc921f2d","html":"<h1 id=\"1-기본정보\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#1-%EA%B8%B0%EB%B3%B8%EC%A0%95%EB%B3%B4\" aria-label=\"1 기본정보 permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>1. 기본정보</h1>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>일정</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>2022년 8월 26일 21:00 (40분)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>튜터 정보</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>튜터 이름: Yunji</li>\n<li>튜터 대학 / 전공: Yale University / Computer Science &#x26; Economics</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<br/>\n<h1 id=\"2-사전-준비\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#2-%EC%82%AC%EC%A0%84-%EC%A4%80%EB%B9%84\" aria-label=\"2 사전 준비 permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>2. 사전 준비</h1>\n<h2 id=\"1-article--is-stem-the-only-path-to-success\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#1-article--is-stem-the-only-path-to-success\" aria-label=\"1 article  is stem the only path to success permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>1.

What should one consider when choosing their major or career path?</strong></p>\n<p>I think sustainability goes first. For example, if I have no interest in what I do then my job or major is not sustainable. I don’t want to improve my skills for the job and I’ll end up hating the job. Also, we have to keep watching if our major or career is needed in society.</p>\n<br/>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(Correction) I think job sustainability is the most important factor. For example, a job is not sustainable if I have no interest in it. I will not want to improve my skills for the job and end up hating it. Also, we have to keep watch for whether our major or career is desired or needed in society.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\n<p><strong>Q3. If you work in STEM, do you have a job that didn’t exist a century ago?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, I’m currently work as a DevOps engineer which didn’t exist 20th century.

The ‘computer’ in that era has very limited functions and only limited people have access to it. So there wasn’t such a job, ‘DevOps Engineer’. However, with rapid increase in computing power, demand for developers has risen sharply. Handling applications and infrastructure is getting complex. That’s why DevOps engineer exists.

For instance, when I worked in the procurement team at NTT Korea, a subsidiary of Japanese telecom company, HQ introduced an automation tool called UiPath. UiPath can automate repetitive task by ‘recording’ your tasks with it. So, if you have a little more interest in technology, you can avoid hassles and focus on the core value.</p>\n<br/>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(Correction) Among STEM, I feel that enhancing knowledge regarding technology is the most important.
